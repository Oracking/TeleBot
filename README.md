# Telebot Project

### About

This project aims to help users keep track of the anime they watch. Normally, an anime follower will have to perform regular checks to determine if there are new episodes for an anime they follow. This bot aims to automate that task.

All you have to do is tell the bot which anime you are following and it will update you every time a new episode of the anime is released. Additionally, if it successfully finds a download link for that episode, it will include it in the update message.

You can search and add @AnimePlugBot on Telegram.
