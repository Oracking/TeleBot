## How to run a script on startup in terminal

# First open a terminal window when the pi starts up by changing this file:

$ nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

# Add the following to the end of the file:

@lxterminal

# Now terminal will open up on startup. Now navigate to /home/<user>/ which
# will be /home/pi/ in the default case. Edit the .bashrc file to run some
# commands every time a terminal window starts. Go to the end of the file and
# add in the following:

echo <your_password> | sudo -S

# The above will run all commands as root

/bin/sleep <some_seconds>

# This will ensure that the network has enough time to connect before running
# your scripts if they require internet connection. Note that this means any 
# terminal you open will sleep for a while before becoming interactive. But
# you can always skip this with CTRL + C

# Now add your script

python /path/to/your/script.py

# The end of your .bashrc file should look like:

echo <password> | sudo -S
/bin/sleep 15
python /path/to/your/script.py
